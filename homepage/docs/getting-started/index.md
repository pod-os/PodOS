# Getting started

## Hosted PodOS apps

The simplest way to use PodOS is by using one of the hosted apps PodOS provides:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :octicons-browser-16:{ .lg .middle } __PodOS Browser__

    ---

    Allows you to browse through Solid Pods, your own or those of your friends and coworkers.

    [:rocket: Launch PodOS Browser](https://browser.pod-os.org)

-   :material-contacts:{ .lg .middle } __PodOS Contacts__

    ---

    :warning: Still in an early, experimental stage. Open address books and manage your contacts.

    [:construction: Try PodOS Contacts](https://contacts.pod-os.org)

## Create your own dashboards

With PodOS elements you can build your own html dashboards to access and visualize data in your Solid Pod the way you prefer. Read the [Quick Start](quick-start.md) to learn more.
